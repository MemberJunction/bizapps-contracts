-- =============================================================================
-- V202611031700 — the renewal-risk label is stored, not computed on every read.
-- =============================================================================
-- Issue #159. vwContracts computed NonRenewalOutcome against the business day,
-- so the same unchanged contract read NULL the day before its end date and 1 the
-- day after. Two training runs over identical rows labelled different sets, and
-- a column that reads the clock cannot be indexed or materialized.
--
-- The label is now a column on Contract, written when a contract concludes:
--
--  * fnContractNonRenewalOutcome holds the rule, once, with the day it is judged
--    on as an explicit argument. The precedence is the one the view used:
--    superseded -> 0 (a renewal IS a supersession); terminated on or before the
--    day -> 1; ended before the day -> 1; otherwise NULL (still open). It is the
--    reverse of State's precedence on purpose: a renewal both terminates the old
--    contract and points it at its successor, and for training that is renewed.
--  * trgContract_RecordNonRenewalOutcome applies it to every inserted or updated
--    row, so a termination or a supersession is recorded by the save that makes
--    it, through any write path, and whatever value a caller sent is replaced.
--  * spRecordContractNonRenewalOutcomes applies it to every row whose stored
--    value differs from the rule today. Expiry has no write behind it (the date
--    simply passes), so a scheduled job (metadata/scheduled-jobs) runs this
--    hourly. It returns how many rows changed.
--
-- The view now reads the stored column through g.*. Everything else in it is
-- carried forward verbatim from V202609211200, including State, which still
-- reads the clock: it is a display value, not a training label.
--
-- "Differs" is EXCEPT, which treats NULL as equal to NULL: a plain <> or a
-- NOT (a = b OR both NULL) is UNKNOWN when one side is NULL, and that is exactly
-- the open-to-concluded change this has to see.
--
-- The trigger only issues its UPDATE when a row's stored label differs, so the
-- __mj_UpdatedAt trigger it fires finds nothing left to change on the second
-- pass and the chain stops.
--
-- Migrations run once, in order: no IF guards.

    -- STATE — the lifecycle, in strict precedence order (ERD §4.5). Read the CASE
    -- top to bottom: the first branch that matches wins, and the order encodes
    -- which fact outranks which.
    --
    --   Terminated  outranks everything ONCE IT HAS TAKEN EFFECT: somebody ended this
    --               agreement, and that is a fact about what happened, not a projection
    --               of the term. It stays Terminated even if the end date later passes.
    --               The boundary is `<= bt.Today`, NOT `IS NOT NULL` (item 13, shipped in
    --               V202608300100 and carried forward here): the Dates tab tells the
    --               user that setting a Terminated Date marks the contract Terminated
    --               FROM that date, so the day itself must read Terminated rather than
    --               Active-until-midnight. A FUTURE TerminatedDate — notice served,
    --               effective later — still reads as not yet terminated, which is why
    --               this is a date comparison and not `IS NOT NULL`.
    --               NOT symmetric with EndDate below, deliberately: an End Date is the
    --               last day the agreement COVERS, a Terminated Date is the day it
    --               STOPS, so `Expired` stays `<` and making the pair match would
    --               expire every contract a day early. (A contract that specifies a
    --               TIME, or an immediate for-cause termination, needs datetime2 — not
    --               expressible here, and out of scope.)
    --   Superseded  the successor FK IS the superseded state — there is no separate
    --               column to disagree with it (R-18 dropped the tautological CHECK).
    --   Expired     the term ran out on its own.
    --   Active      in force: started, not ended, not replaced.
    --   Executed    signed but NOT YET in force (R-19). This branch exists because
    --               without it a contract signed weeks before its term starts fell
    --               through to Draft — indistinguishable from one nobody has touched.
    --               That is the ordinary case in renewal season, not an anomaly.
    --               Draft is a TASK (finish this); Executed is a WAIT (nothing to do
    --               until the date arrives), and a watchlist that merges them makes
    --               finance re-triage the same rows every week.

    -- no start date recorded is Executed, because the signature is the fact that
    -- moved it on.

    --  * the document is found through `__mj.FileEntityRecordLink`, MJ's generic
